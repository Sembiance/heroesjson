## Contributing

Please do.  I have very limited time, and agreed to take over this project just so that
it still breathes live.  However, I have many other projects and this one, unfortunately,
falls to the back of the line.  There are plenty of [issues](https://github.com/nydus/heroesjson/issues)
to tackle!
