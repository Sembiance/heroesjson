The sites have conflicting data between them.
For example, for Azmodan's "First Aid" skill, the correct value is 11.07%
Both heroesnexus.com and heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com get it correct.
But heroesfire.com incorrectly shows 35.49%

Another example, Nova's "Precision Strike" ability does 300 damage, plus another 35 damage per level.
heroesnexus.com assumes you are maximum level 20 for all abilities so it says does 1000 damage  (335 + 35 per level)
First the '335' is wrong, it is '300' but I guess they are not counting level 1.
