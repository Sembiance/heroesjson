* Add hero abilities including 'levels' scaling

* Get Hero HP, Mana and other info from UnitData.xml <CUnit id="HeroJaina"
  Note: To figure out how this changes per level, look at all the 'BehaviorArray' nodes and for each one visit it in the BehaviorData.xml
  Will likely need to make a 'levels' array similar to the talent descriptions
  NOTE: Lost Vikings is three seperate units, so will need to support this some how?
